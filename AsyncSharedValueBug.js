This error occurs when using the Expo `useSharedValue` hook with a function that modifies the value asynchronously. The problem is that the shared value is not updated until the next render cycle, leading to unexpected behavior or incorrect state. For example, if you're fetching data and updating a shared value with the results, the UI might not immediately reflect the changes, even though the shared value has been updated.  This is because the asynchronous operation (fetching data) doesn't trigger an immediate re-render.
